</div>

**Tunix (Tune-in-JAX)** is a JAX based library designed to streamline the
post-training of Large Language Models. It provides efficient and scalable
support for:

- **SOTA Training performance on TPUs**
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- **Agentic RL**

Tunix leverages the power of JAX for accelerated computation and seamless
integration with JAX-based modeling frameworks like
[Flax NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx_basics.html), and
integrates with high-performance inference engines like vLLM and SGLang-JAX for
rollout. **For our detailed documentation, please refer to the [Tunix Website](https://tunix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)**.


**Current Status: V2 Release**

Tunix is under active development. Our team is actively working on expanding its
capabilities, usability and performance. Stay tuned for upcoming updates and new
features! See [Talks and Announcements](https://tunix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/talks.html) for latest updates, talks, and blog posts.


## High Level Architecture
Tunix serves as a state-of-the-art post-training library within the JAX training
stack, positioned to leverage foundational tools like Flax, Optax, Orbax, etc.
for efficient model refinement. It sits as an intermediate layer between these
core utilities and optimized models like MaxText and MaxDiffusion, streamlining
tuning workflows on top of the XLA and JAX infrastructure. See [Design Overview](https://tunix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design.html) for more details on the architecture.

## Collaborations and Partnership
[GRL](https://github.com/lmgame-org/GRL/blob/tunix_integration_dev/README.md)
(Game Reinforcement Learning), developed by
[Hao AI Lab](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/) from UCSD, is an open-source
framework for post-training large language models through multi-turn RL on
challenging games. In collaboration with Tunix, GRL integrates seamless TPU
support—letting users quickly run scalable, reproducible RL experiments (like
PPO rollouts on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct) on TPU v4 meshes with
[minimal setup](https://github.com/lmgame-org/GRL/blob/tunix_integration_dev/README.md#5-launch-the-quick-test-defaults-to-qwen2505b-supports-4-tpu-v4-with-mesh-22).
This partnership empowers the community to push LLM capabilities further,
combining Tunix’s optimized TPU runtime with GRL’s flexible game RL pipeline for
cutting-edge research and easy reproducibility.
